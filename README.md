# adminpanel

Completed: May 2016

For this project the main goal was to build a user friendly admin panel with a login screen to manage data from the from the Alien Abduction intakeform. The admin panel is separate database that can read, add, delete, update, and search data without having to login into phpMyAdmin.

### Challenges:

One of the main challenges was connecting the database to the form. I had to make sure to include the correct database name, table name and access information. If any of these are misspelled or not accurate, the database won't connect. 

### What I learned:

I learned how to send data from the the Alien Abduction form to a database and develop a user-friendly admin panel with a crud database.
